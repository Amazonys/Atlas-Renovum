 parlement_general: "Parlement-General"
 parlement_general_desc: "The $parlement_general$ is a local legislative center developed from a hybridization of French and British traditions. While the votes of different estates within the Parlement-General are weighed differently, they are apportioned by relative size of each faction. Parlement-Generals are tasked with local governance of an area, and provide autonomous control through such legislative apparatus."
