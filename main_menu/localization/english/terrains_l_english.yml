 TERRAIN_ATTACKER_PENALTY_TT: "This [location|e] gives penalty of [Location.GetAttackerPenalty|-=] to the [attacker|e] in [combat|e]."
 TERRAIN_CAN_FREEZE_OVER: "Can freeze during winter, blocking [ships|e] from moving and allowing [armies|e] to cross."
 TERRAIN_BLOCKS_IN_WINTER: "[armies|e] can not enter during $STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_winter_normal$ or $STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_winter_severe$."
 
 flatland_desc: "Flatland represents terrain that does not have any major topographic variation, so there are no impediments for [army|e] movement or [building|e] development."
 mountains_desc: "Mountain terrain has high altitude and also steep slopes with relatively few and narrow flat areas, so it is more difficult for [armies|e] to cross and fight in it, and also more difficult to develop."
 hills_desc: "A terrain with hills has variations in the topography, but the slopes are not as steep nor as high as those of mountains, so the penalties are also not as bad."
 plateau_desc: "They represent relatively flat areas situated at high altitude, so they have some penalties compared to flatlands due to their elevation."
 wetlands_desc: "$wetlands$ are terrain that is partially flooded, generally due to being near a river, lake, or coast."
 ocean_desc: "This is the open seas between the continents, where only the best of ships can travel."
 deep_ocean_desc: "This is the open seas between the continents, where only the best of ships can travel, in the furthest areas from any coast."
 coastal_ocean_desc: "This is the open seas between the continents, where only the best of ships can travel, but in the areas closer to the coast."
 inland_sea_desc: "Inland seas represent the land-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean or the Baltic."
 atoll_desc: "Atolls are circular low-altitude islands that usually encircle a lagoon."
 narrows_desc: "Narrows are areas of sea with proximity of coast on many sides, like straits or the sea inside archipelagos, where there is not much space for movement."
 lakes_desc: "Lakes represent inland bodies of water without any contact with the open sea except through possible rivers, so no [ships|e] of relevance are able to sail in them."
